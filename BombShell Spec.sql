 /*Hi I own a store called BombShell and we sell top quality cotton shells.
Having to constantly count my inventory and running the store chasing costs and profit margins is taking too much time 
and so my partner and I decided to go electronically. 
I was referred to you as I was told you were the best to reach out for help.

I have many colors including
white, black, nude, yellow, gray, brown, pink, purple, blue, and navy 

I have 2 of each size -small, medium, and large

I purchase them at wholesale for 6$ each and sell them for 12.99$ each

Each shell has its own SKU number so that i can differentiate when checking all my inventory and count

I have two styles in each color - ''Elbow'' and ''wrist'' 

Questions:
1.Do you sell any other fabrics?
no, we only sell the top quality Eygptian cotton and thats what the clients love from my shells. 

2. Would you ever sell it less than you bought it for?
no

3. Do you need to store from who/which company you purchased the shells from and how much?
for now, I am buying from the same seller.
 

Reports:
1. A daily printout every morning including the Inventory in stock, style, color, size,
date purchased, price purchased, date sold, price sold, and the date and time record of that printout to refer if i had to give a hardcopy to my partner.

2. Printout of sku, style, color, size, date purchase, price purchase, date sold, price sold

3. which style is giving me most profit 

4. which size sells the most

5. avg how long does it take for inventory to be sold per color each week
